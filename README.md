# CamRaff - Milestone Project 2 - Craffty's Farm

![displays]()

Here is a link to the deployed site: [Craffty's Farm](https://camraff.github.io/Crafftys-Farm_MP2/ "Craffty's Farm")

For my second MilestoneProject on my course through Code Institute via UCP (University Centre Peterborough), I thought it would be fun to produce a site which had the opportunity to be used in an educational way, with a scope to make it usable for parents and teachers to make learning fun for their children. The idea was to make it fun and informative, while also keeping it relatively basic so that children would be able to navigate it themselves.

# Design and Development

## Wireframes

Below you can see the initial mock-ups for each page of the website. The ideas behind each page will be explained beneath the images.

### Desktop

This is the initial mock-up for the three different kinds of pages on the site when displayed on a wide or desktop view.

- #### Home

![dektop-home-wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/Home%20.png)

For this page, I wanted to keep the design simple with a main navigation bar and a footer which will be displayed the same across all pages. As this is just the home/landing page, I didn't want to flood the user with too much information. There will be a brief introduction to the site displayed in the center of the page, and a button which will take you to the interactive/game area. The button to access the interactive/game area will also be the same as one of the links in the navigation bar, for ease of access. 

- #### Game Area

![game-area-congratulations](assets/images/wireframes/Game%20Area%20Congratulations.png)

This is where most of the interactivity will be encountered. This page will display something similar to a memory game, however it is not actually a game, so there will be no score or anything being counted. The purpose of finding a match is to hear the sounds of the animal which you've found the matching pair for, and to have the user then be able to access the information page available for that animal. Upon finding a match, you will see in the 2nd image that a box will appear, congratulating you and giving you the option to continue on to the information page, or return back to the interactive area. 

- #### Info Page

![info-page](assets/images/wireframes/Animal%20Information.png)

This is where the user will find the information page. Here, there will be images of the animal they correctly matched the pair for, and also a body of text containing the information about that animal. 

### Mobile

As I decided to keep the home page relatively basic, that will be displayed the same on mobiles and tablets (aside from the relocation of the nav bar seen below), so I have only provided images of the game area and information pages.

- #### Info Page

The mobile versions once more don't change much, it is mostly just a shift from a horizontal display to more of a vertical display.
