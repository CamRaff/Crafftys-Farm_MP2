# CamRaff - Milestone Project 2 - Craffty's Farm

![displays]()

Here is a link to the deployed site: [Craffty's Farm](https://camraff.github.io/Crafftys-Farm_MP2/ "Craffty's Farm")

For my second MilestoneProject on my course through Code Institute via UCP (University Centre Peterborough), I thought it would be fun to produce a site which had the opportunity to be used in an educational way, with a scope to make it usable for parents and teachers to make learning fun for their children. The idea was to make it fun and informative, while also keeping it relatively basic so that children would be able to navigate it themselves.

# Design and Development

## Wireframes

Below you can see the initial mock-ups for each page of the website. The ideas behind each page will be explained beneath the images.

### Desktop

This is the initial mock-up for the three different kinds of pages on the site when displayed on a wide or desktop view.

- #### Home

![dektop-home-wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/home.png)

For this page, I wanted to keep the design simple with a main navigation bar and a footer which will be displayed the same across all pages. As this is just the home/landing page, I didn't want to flood the user with too much information. There will be a brief introduction to the site displayed in the center of the page, and a button which will take you to the interactive/game area. The button to access the interactive/game area will also be the same as one of the links in the navigation bar, for ease of access. 

- #### Game Area

![game-area](assets/images/wireframes/game-area.png)

![game-area-congratulations](assets/images/wireframes/game-area-congratulations.png)

This is where most of the interactivity will be encountered. This page will display something similar to a memory game, however it is not actually a game, so there will be no score or anything being counted. The purpose of finding a match is to hear the sounds of the animal which you've found the matching pair for, and to have the user then be able to access the information page available for that animal. Upon finding a match, you will see in the 2nd image that a box will appear, congratulating you and giving you the option to continue on to the information page, or return back to the interactive area. 

- #### Info Page

![info-page](assets/images/wireframes/animal-info.png)

This is where the user will find the information page. Here, there will be images of the animal they correctly matched the pair for, and also a body of text containing the information about that animal. 

### Mobile

As I decided to keep the home page relatively basic, that will be displayed the same on mobiles and tablets (aside from the relocation of the nav bar seen below), so I have only provided images of the game area and information pages.

- #### Game Area

- #### Info Page

<img src="assets/images/wireframes/animal-info-mobile.png" alt="wireframe for the mobile version of the info page" height="600">

The mobile versions once more don't change much, it is mostly just a shift from a horizontal display to more of a vertical display.

## Images

Because I wanted to have this project designed so it could be used as a way to entertain kids by their parents or teachers, I decided to go with a majority cartoon-y theme. All of the images used for the game tiles were designed by AI from [Microsoft's Copilot AI](https://copilot.microsoft.com) using prompts from myself. The background was acquired from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com), and was designed [@brgfx](https://www.freepik.com/author/brgfx).

### Background

<img src="assets/images/background.webp" alt="the image used as the background of the website" height="400">

In keeping with the farm theme, I wanted something that was simple but also visually appealing, and would look nice as a background. I found this image while searching for images of empty fields and thought the addition of the fence was great, so I decided to use this as the background for the entire site.

### Game Tiles

As with the background, since I was designing this towards children, I went with very cartoon-y, almost cutesy designs.

### Info Pages

On the information pages, I decided it would be a good idea to have some realistic images of the animals as this is where the learning will occur, and though learning via cartoons is possible, I felt it would be better for them to get an actual understanding of the real life animals. I also thought it would be a good idea for them to see both sides of the animal, with one image being slightly more humorous than the other. On mobile, one of the images will be hidden, so I am going to go with the humorous photo to be displayed on smaller screens. All of the images seen below were acquired from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com), and the individuals have been tagged under each image.

### Favicons

The browser tab image used in this site were acquired using the [Favicon](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). 

## Fonts

For the font on the site, I decided to go with something that was quite rounded on the edges and soft on the eyes, as it is designed for children. I didn't want the ltters and words to be too sharp. I got this idea when doing a bit of research on childrens sites and I came across the [Pepaa Pig](https://www.peppapig.com/en-us) website. 

After taking a look at the fonts available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), I decided upon two different fonts, one to be used for headers and in the navigation bar, and one for body text. 

### Margarine

<img src="assets/images/margarine.png" alt="the font Margarine, acquired from Google Fonts" height="100">

I chose the font [Margarine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Margarine?preview.text=Welcome%20to%20Craffys%20Farm&preview.layout=grid) for the headers and navigation bars as it is very soft but also stands out very well.

### LXGW WenKai Mono TC

<img src="assets/images/lxgw.png" alt="the font LXGW WenKai Mono TC, acquired from Google Fonts" height="100">

I chose the font [LXGW WenKai Mono TC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/LXGW+WenKai+Mono+TC?preview.text=Welcome%20to%20Craffys%20Farm&preview.layout=grid) for the body text as it is a bit easier to read over long periods than Margarine, yet it still has a soft and rounded feel.
